# Album-Review-Ratings
In this project I used a compilation of Album Reviews Ratings made by Kauvin Lucas at Kaggle to do an Exploratory Data Analysis and answer some questions about the data.
The Metal Edition is a second exploratory data analysis on the same compilation but only with Heavy Metal artits.

The questions were:

    What are the most acclaimed albums of each of the year in the millenium (2000-2020) by the users?
    What are the most hyped records year by year by the users.
    What artists generate the most hype?
    What are the most critically acclaimed artists of the millennium?
    Which genre generates the most feedback either from the critics and from the users?
    What are albums with the most negative reception, either from the critics and from the users?
    Which EP album was the most hyped?
    What release months are the most well received by the users and critics?
    Which records not well received by the users are most critically acclaimed?
    Which records not well received by the critic are the most acclaimed by the users?
